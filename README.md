# colesavage.ca

Simple site for a friend running in a local election. Based on a sanity.io starter. This was my first time using Sanity, and I'm not sure I would again.

## Tech

* React
* Next.js
* Netlify (Deployment)
* Sanity.io (CMS)

## Setup 

* It's probably easier just to clone the [original repo](https://github.com/sanity-io/sanity-template-nextjs-landing-pages) from Sanity. They also hav a quick way of setting everything up [here](https://www.sanity.io/create?template=sanity-io/sanity-template-nextjs-landing-pages).

## Issues

* I don't love the Typeform. A simple HTML form would probably be sufficient.
